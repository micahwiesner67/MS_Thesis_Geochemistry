## Plain Language Summary
Understanding past climate and environmental conditions is accomplished through using a variety of archives left behind in the rock and sediment record. 
One common example of this is when scientists study past atmospheres on Earth by analyzing gas bubbles in ice frozen long ago. 
A common geologic archive which is used to give a quantitative understanding of past temperature is the chemistry of calcite. 
Calcite is an extremely common mineral on Earth's surface (it is a component of seashells, coral reefs, and forms naturally in lakes, oceans, caves, and soils).
Calcite is made of oxygen and carbon in the form of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. 
My Master's Thesis focused on analyzing the chemistry, isotopically, of calcite in a lake called Fayetteville Green Lake. 
We undertook field work, collection of water and calcite samples, in addition to laboratory chemistry work, analysis of the calcite, in addition 
to data analysis.
