This basic analysis was undertaken in April 2020. In water with a consistent oxygen isotope chemistry the oxygen isotope chemistry of calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) gives an indication of the temperature in which the calcite was formed. The carbon isotope chemistry often gives a clue as to how the calcite was formed as photosynthetic processes can lead to a different carbon isotope signature in calcite. I used K-means unsupervised learning to determine how many clusters of calcite were sampled between May,2019 and October, 2019 from Fayetteville Green Lake. I am still uncertain as to how to interpret the results.

<b>Questions:</b>
1. Can K-means clustering indicate different 'regimes' of calcite formation in Fayetteville Green Lake?
2. How many 'regimes' of calcite formation does K-means clustering suggest?

<b>Data Analysis:</b>  
All analysis and visualization done in R using *tidyverse *ggmap* *usmap* *fpc* *cluster* *factoextra*
The 'elbow' method and 'silhouette' method were used to confirm the proper number of clusters.

<b>Conclusion:</b>  
Statistically, it is possible that calcite sourced from Fayetteville Green Lake has two or three distinct ‘regimes’ of formation. Further analysis is required to pair this to a depth or season of formation.
